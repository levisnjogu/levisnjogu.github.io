						One of my personal favourites from the many poets who graced the Def Poetry stage was Bassey whose delivery and the subject of her poetry resonated very much with my work. Her themes dwelled alot on identity. Being a Nigerian who moved to the US at the age of 4 and the assimilation that was taking over her struggle to hold on to her ancestry, this dilema can very be seen in her performance, Homeward.Bassey will be the featured poet at the monthly event that will take place on 1st September at the Phoenix Players theater.

						Standing here It's beautiful outside tonight Tonight, the sky seems lit by a million stars We can trace out the newest shooting stars track their path and whisper wishes under our breaths .We will watch them burn brightly then die but the sky will remain lit for a million nights after,We will hoose to ignore the fact that it's the star dusts that count for we were taught to wish upon shooting stars.

						Whether performed by Tu-pac through Rap, Mutabaruka through Dub or Wally Serote, Poetry has been spoken into life. The performance of Spoken Word has changed how we tell our stories. This is evident in the manner in which we have found ways to say no and yes in performance without those words.This Performance Poetry master class asks these questions.How can you make stories with the words that are your mother's words? How are we writing and performing various performance styles? How many words do we need to make a story? Who are we writing to?
